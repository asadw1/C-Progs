This is a repo for small C and C++ "demo" programs. I am open to suggestions and collaboration, and any best practices in these languages. 
I hope to continually update this and get stronger at debugging memory leaks, memory overwrites, etc. using gdb. I will be updating this
with programs and documentation periodically.
