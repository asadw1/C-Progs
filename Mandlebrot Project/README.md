UPDATE 12/14 - Recently added the completed program. This application generates a 1024x1024 .ppm file image when run


This is a directory containing information about my latest pet project, the Mandlebrot program. 
I plan to gather some resources to write a small application to generate a Mandlebrot fractal.
I haven't thought about implementing any "Save" type of feature or interactive zooming options. 
This is simply a self-demonstration of what is possible in C++. 
 
More information about the Mandlebrot set and required components can be found below.
