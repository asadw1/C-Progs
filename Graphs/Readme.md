# Graphs

Just a small program I wrote to print out a graph in adjacency matrix format. It worked, then didn't work, then worked again, and is now currently
not working again in terms of what's happening in the output. I haven't done any real testing on this but I do remember entering some bad data and
it seg-faulting...something to investigate then in the meantime. /done_ranting
