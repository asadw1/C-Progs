README

This is a C program demonstrating merge-sort algorithm. MergeSort works by splitting 
an array into single elements, then recursively merging them back in non-decreasing
order until all elements are sorted. This algorithm in the worst case runs in
O(n*log(n)) time, which is not bad, if we compare it to something like Insertion Sort 
which will run in O(n^2) time, highly undesirable for large inputs.
